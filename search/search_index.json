This entire endeavor started when one of our fellow users @hermy65 posed a simple, but complex question in another forum topic (see post #3). I decided to give it a shot, as I am an IT professional, specifically in enterprise data warehouse/SQL server. After a few days of hard work, UUD version 1.0 was released. We are currently on Version 1.5, and the project is in active development. If you are a Grafana developer, or have had experience building dashboards/panels for UNRAID, please let me know. I would love to collaborate.

# Ultimate UNRAID Dashboard 1.5.x
The Ultimate UNRAID Dashboard <span style="color:green">Version 1.5</span> is here! This is another HUGE üòÅ update adding <span style="color:green">INTEGRATED PLEX Monitoring</span> via Varken/Tautulli. This update is loosely derived from the official Varken dashboard, but I stripped it down to the bolts, modded the crap out of it, and streamlined it with a straight Plex focus. Honestly, the only code that sill remains from their official dash is the single geo-mapping graph, as it is not actually an editable panel, but rather straight JSON code. I wanted to say thank you to that team for providing a great baseline to start from, and all of their previous work!

The UUD Version 1.5 adds <span style="color:green">50 new Panels within 3 new sections</span>. I have placed these strategically within the UUD right below the Overwatch section, as this is the second data set that I would want to see, right after my overall server health. As always, with greater features, comes a greater need for plugins and dependencies. I have provided links and resources below to help you along.

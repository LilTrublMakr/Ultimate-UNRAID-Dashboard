Dependencies UNRAID Plugin: Community Applications Docker: InfluxDB Docker: Telegraf Docker: Grafana Docker: Tautulli Docker: Varken CA Plugin: IPMI Tools License: GeoLite2 Guide Install Community Applications This is a must have for any UNRAID Server. If you already have Community Applications (CA) installed, you can skip to the next step. On your UNRAID server, click on the Plugins tab on your toolbar. You should see a option Enter URL of remote plugin file or local plugin file . Enter https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Squidly271/community.applications/master/plugins/community.applications.plg and click on the Install buton. You should now see an Apps tab on your toolbar.

We need to set up the configuration file first! telegraf.conf In your settings, you should have noted a path in the previous step for Host Path 7 . You need to navigate to that folder (you will probably have to create the telegraf folder) and place a telegraf.conf file in that folder. Default Config File You can find a default telegraf.conf on the official Telegraf GitHub . Raw version . If you want to edit the default config, here are the edits you need to make: Search for [[inputs.net]] Enable by removing the # in the front of the line. Search for [[inputs.docker]] Enable by removing the # in the front of the line. Search for [[inputs.diskio]] Enable by removing the # in the front of the line. To use static drive serial numbers in Grafana (for DiskIO queries) do the following: Edit telegraf.conf > [[inputs.diskio]] > uncomment the line (remove the #) with device_tags = [\"ID_SERIAL\"] . Use ID_SERIAL flag in Grafana. Now upon booting, you don't have to worry about SD mounts changing. You can also set up overrides on the query fields map the serial number to a common disk name like \"disk01\", etc. Search for [[inputs.smart]] Enable by removing the # in the front of the line. Also enable attributes = true by removing the # in the front of the line. Search for [[inputs.ipmi_sensor]] Enable by removing the # in the front of the line. Search for [[inputs.apcupsd]] Enable by removing the # in the front of the line. In UNRAID settings > UPS Settings, make sure Start APC UPS daemon is set to Yes . When completed, this file should be placed in the folder that we noted above. (Default is /mnt/user/appdata/telegraf/ ). Continue to the next step .

This file should be placed in the folder that we noted above. (Default is /mnt/user/appdata/telegraf/ ). Continue to the next step . Start the Container Now, we can finally start the container. Click on Apply to start the container. When you are back on the Docker tab of UNRAID, click on the logs button on the far right side of the Telegraf container to open the container logs.
